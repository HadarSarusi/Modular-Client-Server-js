# 🏗️ Fullstack Architecture Fundamentals 🏗️
### ⚙️ Vanilla JavaScript Client–Server Simulation Project

> 🎓 Academic architectural reconstruction project  
> 🧠 Deep system-level understanding of Client–Server separation  
> ⚙️ Implemented entirely in **Vanilla JavaScript (No Frameworks)**  

---

## 📌 Project Overview 📌

This project demonstrates the **core architectural foundations of fullstack systems**
implemented purely with **Vanilla JavaScript**.

Instead of relying on frameworks,
the system reconstructs a structured:

> 🖥 Client Layer  
> 🌐 Network Abstraction Layer  
> 🧠 Server Logic Layer  
> 📦 Data Layer  

All separated into modular components.

The goal is to deeply understand:

- How systems communicate
- How authentication flows work
- How CRUD operations propagate
- How responsibilities are isolated
- How real backend logic can be simulated

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools 🛠️

### 💻 Core Technology
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3

### 🧠 Architectural Focus
- Layered architecture
- Client–Server simulation
- Request/Response abstraction
- Modular file separation
- State transition handling

### 🔐 System Logic
- Authentication validation
- CRUD simulation
- Business logic routing
- Controlled state mutation

No frameworks.
No libraries.
Pure system fundamentals.

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy 🏗️

This project is not UI-focused —
it is **architecture-focused**.

Each logical layer is isolated:

- Client → handles UI & interaction
- Network → simulates API communication
- Server → processes logic & validation
- Data → stores and manages state

This separation mirrors real-world backend systems.

## 📂 Project Structure 📂

```
src/
 ├── client/
 ├── server/
 ├── data/
 ├── utils/
 └── main.js
```

Each directory represents a conceptual system boundary.
